This is a project for Bank Management System in c++. A user can perform many kinds of management tasks to manage customer bank records like adding a new account, modifying and closing it. Also, users can view all customer accounts, check account balance as well as deposit and withdraw money from accounts.

The system automates the basic banking functions to aid in the day-to-day operations of a bank clerk. Also, the goal of the system is to allow for storing details of a large number of customer accounts and allow for add, retrieve and update details of any account. So, the bank management system utilizes JsonCpp library that allows manipulating JSON values.

The basic features of the bank management system are as follows:

Add Account: This operation is necessary when new account needs to be added to the system. For example, when a customer opens a new account, the customer details is inserted in the bankâ€™s account records. This option takes one input, account holder name.
Update Account Details: This function updates details of customer account in the account records.
Close Account: This operation clears the existing record of a customer from the records. It is used when a bank account is closed. So, be careful while performing this operation because the system could loose any important data.
List all current accounts: Show all the available customer accounts from the record of bank management system.
Check Balance
Withdraw Money
Deposit Money
The record of the accounts in the bank management system is stored in the output.json file. Moreover, the system records account holder name, bank account number, id and bank balance.

This system is a small project that implements only some of the complex features of bank. However, one can use this project to make sophisticated system by adding more details/properties to the records and features and function to the system.
